Living greeting cards — create, share, and view.

- **Share links:** After creating a card, use "Copy Share Link" to get a URL like `https://yoursite.com/c/<card-id>`. Recipients can open it without signing in.
- **Public view:** Run the SQL in `supabase-rls-cards-public-read.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor once, so the view page can load cards for share links.
